What should a new player experience if they haven't connected to our Discord?
-Hop in, play, enjoy yourself and want to keep playing. See something, soon, that is to-be-attained. Before, things were too far away and out of sight. Helpful text shown to a new player. Have new player spawn be near a heavy-rp area, this'll be an Impera cultural decision and we'll agree to do some heavy RP there. A New Member's Guide would be helpful for new players, we would like to have a way to get the new player reading it (host it on our discord maybe?).

What's our mission statement? This will help us settle votes that come to a tie.



Let's keep things more centralized to centralize RP, but keep it a little low-key and not obvious. 

See a player heatmap for analytics. See where they go, see where deaths happen, etc.

Weapon crafting recipes for the refined-metal and whatnot

Quantities of weapons need to be figured out, don't let people keeping a shitload of weapons in their trunks, per se. We don't want everyone to own 30 assault rifles

Using a "trainer" will show me where the gps coordinates are

Make a heist, the heist needs to be obvious that it's going on, cuz the police need to get involved. Maybe have a silent alarm that notifies police to bring in that roleplay. (bank robbery, )

Really easily accessible food and drink

The H tag is for processing heroin. 

Getting skill points would help keep players because of the skill gain causing better results from jobs, IE a meth lab not exploding


Mechanic:

Mining: 
Cannabis: seeds, growing, weed-gathering, trimming, curing, and then you sell it in a high-RP area and the police scanner picks it up (scanner could give street, clothes description) Melody suggests a 3 step process.
